Since RSA cannot encrypt large data directly, if your data is larger than 245 bytes, you need to:
Split the data into chunks of â‰¤ 245 bytes.
Encrypt each chunk separately (resulting in 256-byte encrypted chunks).
Send each chunk using client_socket.send().
Receive each chunk using recv(256) and decrypt.
